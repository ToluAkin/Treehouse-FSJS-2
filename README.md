# Treehouse-Unit-2
This contain my solution to the second project of the Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Techdegree.

The second project, pagination and filtering of a list of at least 50 students to show 10 students per page,
paginate each page such that each link is to show another set of 10 students.

Also, the project contains searching through the whole list to by name of a student and if the student does not exist,
an error message is displayed.
