## Pagination and Filtering

The project functionality was built on vanilla javascript. <br><br>
This involves the pagination and filtering of a list of at least 50 students to show 10 students per page,
each paginated link is to display another set of 10 students. This also contains searching through the list of students
by either a letter in the name or more specifically by the first name or last name of a student and if the student 
does not exist, an error message is displayed.
